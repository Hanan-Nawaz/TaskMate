## ❗ Disclaimer

> 🗂️ This project is from when I **first started learning front-end development**.  
> I recently found the old version on my drive.  
>
> So, I:
> - ✅ Converted it from **class-based components** to **functional components**
> - 🧹 Cleaned up the structure
> - 🎨 Redesigned the layout slightly
> - 📤 Pushed it to GitHub as part of my coding archive  
>
> It's not a complex app — but it's meaningful to me as a reminder of where I began.
